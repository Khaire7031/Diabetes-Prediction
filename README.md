## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management are crucial for controlling the progression of the disease and preventing complications. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the probability of an individual having diabetes based on several health factors such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various attributes such as glucose concentration, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, age, and whether the individual has diabetes or not.
